Using Different machine learning for regression problem
A meal delivery company operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfilment/packaging warehouses in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. We are required to help these centres with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centres will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly. The main aim of this project is to create an appropriate machine learning model to forecast then number of orders to gather raw materials for next ten weeks. ML models used are: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, XG Boost
